No Confidence Motion LIVE: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will speak in Parliament at 4pm,
the final day of deliberation regarding the no-confidence motion. PM Modi is likely to respond to all allegations,
particularly those put forth by the opposition’s Rahul Gandhi and other opposition leaders.
The primary subjects of concern include allegations of nepotism, a dynastic approach, corruption,
and even the assertion that India’s alliances are driven by opportunism. Although the motion is likely to meet defeat,
the BJP aims for a substantial margin of victory to undermine the notion of a united opposition.
